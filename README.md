# Access-Key-Manager
Project Title: Access Key Manager
Project Objective
Micro-Focus Inc., a software company has built a school management platform that is 
multitenant i.e., various schools can set up on the platform as though the platform was 
built specifically for them. They have agreed to use an access key-based approach to 
monetize it rather than building payment features into the school software. They have 
decided to outsource the project to you, to build a key manager, a web application that
schools can use to purchase access keys to activate their school account.
